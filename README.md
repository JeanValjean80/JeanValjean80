### Hi there, I'm Frank! 👋
I’ve been in the IT and software development game for over two decades, and I’m passionate about it. Since I started my own IT business in 2001, I’ve been creating software solutions using C# and Microsoft technologies. I’m always in to take a look for new programming languages like Swift, Rust and Go. I also do game development with Unity. My work goes beyond just writing code. I also provide reliable IT support services and create modern, user-friendly websites that are both functional and visually appealing. I also love sharing my knowledge by teaching programming courses for teens and adults. Whether it’s fixing broken systems, creating user-friendly websites, or teaching the basics of coding, my mission is to make technology fun, easy to use, and accessible to everyone.
