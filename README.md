### Hi there, I'm Frank! 👋
With over two decades of hands-on experience, I bring a deep passion for IT and software development to everything I do. Since founding my own IT business in 2001, I’ve specialized in creating software solutions with C# and Microsoft technologies, while always keeping an eye on emerging trends like Swift and game development with Unity. My work doesn’t stop at writing code – I also support clients with reliable IT support services and create modern, user-friendly websites that are both functional and visually appealing. In addition, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through programming courses for teens and adults. Whether it’s troubleshooting systems, designing clean web interfaces, or teaching the basics of coding, my goal is to make technology accessible, practical, and engaging for everyone.
